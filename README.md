# Greetings! 👋

My name is Mihai and I am thrilled to introduce myself as a electronics engineering student at the prestigious University Politehnica of Bucharest (UPB). As an avid learner, I am always on the lookout for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.

Here are some of the skills that I have acquired so far:

* Java
* Web development
* PHP
* C++
* MySQL

My ultimate goal is to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry by constantly exploring new technologies and finding innovative ways to apply my knowledge and skills. I am always open to collaboration and learning new things.

You can check out my resume on my Github repository (https://github.com/12mihai05/12mihai05) to get a more in-depth look at my experiences and projects. Additionally, you can find me on Github as 12mihai05 and LinkedIn, where you can see my skills, experiences, and projects.
